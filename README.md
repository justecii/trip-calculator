## About 
For this project, I decided to make a single-page-app for the Trip Calculator using the ReactJS platform with Javascript as the base language. I enjoy using React for SPA so I thought it was a natural fit for this app that really doesn't need to be too bloated to achieve its purpose. React lays everything out easily and makes it really simple to organize the contents of your app by creating a component for each main aspect and then arranging them appropriately. I decided to arrange the App as a Parent Component (simply App.js) that has 4 children components (UserOne.js, UserTwo.js, UserThree.js, and Tally.js).
